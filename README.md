> The best time to learn to code is ten years ago. The next best time is now.

I'm Joe. I'm doing my best to practice enough of what I have learned from tutorials in order to not be an imposter and add things to my - currently empty - list of assets.

I'm 35 (gasp!) years old. I am married to my sweetheart Danielle and we have five absolutely adorable kids.

I'll add more to this later. 

## 6 October 2020

I'm going through page one of the Github guide.
